    "# Recommender Systems (and their implementations in Python)\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommender systems are among the most popular applications of data science today. They are used to predict the \"rating\" or \"preference\" that a user would give to an item. Almost every major tech company has applied them in some form or the other: Amazon uses it to suggest products to customers, YouTube uses it to decide which video to play next on autoplay, and Facebook uses it to recommend pages to like and people to follow. What's more, for some companies -think Netflix and Spotify-, the business model and its success revolves around the potency of their recommendations. In fact, Netflix even offered a million dollars in 2009 to anyone who could improve its system by 10%.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will see how to build a basic model of simple as well as content-based recommender systems. While these models will be nowhere close to the industry standard in terms of complexity, quality or accuracy, it will help you to get started with building more complex models that produce even better results.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what are these recommender systems?\n",
    "\n",
    "Broadly, recommender systems can be classified into 3 types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Simple recommenders__: offer generalized recommendations to every user, based on movie popularity and/or genre. The basic idea behind this system is that movies that are more popular and critically acclaimed will have a higher probability of being liked by the average audience. IMDB Top 250 is an example of this system.\n",
    "- __Content-based recommenders__: suggest similar items based on a particular item. This system uses item metadata, such as genre, director, description, actors, etc. for movies, to make these recommendations. The general idea behind these recommender systems is that if a person liked a particular item, he or she will also like an item that is similar to it.\n",
    "- __Collaborative filtering engines__: these systems try to predict the rating or preference that a user would give an item-based on past ratings and preferences of other users. Collaborative filters do not require item metadata like its content-based counterparts."

    "## Simple Recommenders\n",

    "The following are the steps involved:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Decide on the metric or score to rate movies on.\n",
    "- Calculate the score for every movie.\n",
    "- Sort the movies based on the score and output the top results.\n",

    "One of the most basic metrics you can think of is the **rating**. However, using this metric has a few *caveats*. For one, it does not take into consideration the **popularity** (which is very important) of a movie. Therefore, a movie with a rating of `9` from `10` voters will be considered `'better'` than a movie with a rating of `8.9` from `10,000` voters.\n",
    "\n",
    "On a related note, this metric will also tend to favor movies with smaller number of voters with skewed and/or extremely high ratings. As the number of voters increase, the rating of a movie *regularizes* and approaches towards a value that is reflective of the movie's quality. It is more difficult to discern the quality of a movie with **extremely** few voters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking these shortcomings into consideration, it is necessary that you come up with a **weighted rating** that takes into account the average rating and the number of votes it has garnered. Such a system will make sure that a movie with a `9` rating from `100,000` voters gets a (far) **higher** score than a YouTube Web Series with the same rating but a few hundred voters.\n",

The selectivity of your filter is up to your discretion (usually done in trial and error).\n",

(On the other hand, if you had chosen the `75th` percentile, you would have considered the top `25%` of the movies in terms of the number of votes garnered.

    "## Collaborative Filtering with Python\n",
    "In this tutorial, you have learnt how to build your very own **Simple** and **Content Based** Movie Recommender Systems. There is also another extremely popular type of recommender known as **collaborative filters**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collaborative filters can further be classified into two types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- User-based Filtering: these systems recommend products to a user that similar users have liked. For example, let's say Alice and Bob have a similar interest in books (that is, they largely like and dislike the same books). Now, let's say a new book has been launched into the market and Alice has read and loved it. It is therefore, highly likely that Bob will like it too and therefore, the system recommends this book to Bob.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Item-based Filtering: these systems are extremely similar to the content recommendation engine that you built. These systems identify similar items based on how people have rated it in the past. For example, if Alice, Bob and Eve have given 5 stars to The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, the system identifies the items as similar. Therefore, if someone buys The Lord of the Rings, the system also recommends The Hobbit to him or her.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will not be building these systems in this tutorial but you are already familiar with most of the ideas required to do so. A good place to start with collaborative filters is by examining the MovieLens dataset, which can be found [here](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "In this tutorial, you have covered how to build simple as well as content-based recommenders. Hopefully, you are now in a good position to make improvements on the basic systems you built and experiment with other kinds of recommenders (such as collaborative filters). I hope you had as much fun reading this as I had writing. Happy recommending!"
